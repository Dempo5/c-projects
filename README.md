## Project Structure

```
c-programming/
    beginner/        // basic input/output, if/else, loops
    intermediate/    // functions, arrays, strings, pointers
    advanced/        // data structures, algorithms, recursion
```

## How to Compile

Using GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o program
./program
```

(Windows PowerShell also uses `./program`)
